This Python program predicts progression outcomes for students based on the number of credits they have at pass, defer, and fail levels. The program prompts users for input and validates it, displaying appropriate messages for incorrect input types, out-of-range values, or incorrect totals. It efficiently utilizes conditional statements to determine outcomes without excessive branching.

The program also allows for predicting outcomes for multiple students in a loop, with an option to quit when desired. Upon quitting, it generates a histogram representing the distribution of progression outcomes and displays the total number of students for each category.

Additionally, the program provides extensions:

Part 2: Stores input data in a list or nested list and prints the stored data in a specific format.
Part 3: Saves inputted progression data to a text file and later accesses the stored data to print it out.
Part 4: Saves input progression data to a dictionary or nested dictionary, including unique student IDs, and displays the data accordingly.
The program uses user-defined functions as appropriate and employs descriptive variable and function names for clarity and readability.

The solution aims for modularity, efficiency, and readability while fulfilling the requirements outlined in the coursework specifications.
